# Rainforest Birds Audio Analysis

An ML-powered system for isolating and classifying bird calls from rainforest recordings, built in collaboration with Rainforest Connection (RFCx).

## Project Overview

This project processes and analyzes audio recordings from rainforest environments to identify and classify bird species. It handles real-world challenges including:
- Background noise removal
- Overlapping sound separation
- Variable recording quality compensation
- Species classification

## Technical Stack

- **Language**: Python 3.12
- **ML Framework**: PyTorch
- **Audio Processing**: librosa
- **Development**: PyCharm/DataSpell
- **Version Control**: Git

## Data Sources

The system utilizes two primary data sources:
- Rainforest Connection (RFCx) field recordings
- Xeno-canto reference recordings for model training
